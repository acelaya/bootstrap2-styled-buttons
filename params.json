{"name":"Bootstrap2-styled-buttons","tagline":"Bootstrap 3 buttons with Bootstrap 2 style","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nMaster: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acelaya/bootstrap2-styled-buttons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acelaya/bootstrap2-styled-buttons)\r\n\r\nDevelop: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acelaya/bootstrap2-styled-buttons.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/acelaya/bootstrap2-styled-buttons)\r\n\r\nThis little stylesheet reverts new Bootstrap 3 button styles to the old ones, including `.btn-inverse` again.\r\n\r\nThe `.btn-primary` style is based on the [Bootstrap 3 theme](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/), but a `.btn-old-primary` was included with the old shiny blue primary button.\r\n\r\nThey are compatible with the new Bootstrap 3 buttons styles and have the new padding, to fit with other form controls.\r\n\r\nDisabled, focused and active styles are supported, as well as `.btn-lg`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-xs` and `.btn-block`.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nInclude one of the files located in the css folder (bootstrap-buttons.css or bootstrap-buttons.min.css) in your Bootstrap 3 project after bootstrap stylesheets to get the old styled buttons.\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\nThe building process has been automated by using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Take a look at its [documentation](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for more information.\r\n\r\nThe automation script just compiles the SASS stylesheets, creating a normal and a minified CSS stylesheets in the css directory.\r\n\r\nIt requires [compass](http://compass-style.org/) to properly work.","google":"UA-38351554-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
